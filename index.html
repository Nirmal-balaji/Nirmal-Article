  Are you thinking the World, what we are currently viewing through our Eyes is Complete Reality ? The Answer for this question is absolutely "No". This Article is not based on Spirituality or Philosophy it is based on Scientific observations and what we are going to discuss is purely science. In our Human brain, If we see which part is most important for visualizing the reality around us, is Sensory organs. Because through sensory organ only we are sensing this outside world. So we need to focus on how our sensory organ is developing ? Is it developing while the baby is inside the mother stomach ? The Answer for this is also absolutely "No". So, lets we see how the parts in our brain which reacts sensing is developed ? We all know that until 3 days the Newborn baby isn't able to open their eyes. After the baby opens the Eyes, this part of our brain starts to develop by touching the other person's face and whatever the baby sees it will have a thought to touch that object and feel it, how it is? then once the baby feels that it saves in his brain permanently. After that whenever the baby sees that object or similar object the brain of the baby gives the signal that how it feels The Next Sensory organ to be developed, is taste and smell, so this we all know that the baby taste his finger, then it will start to keep all the things in mouth and nose, whatever the baby sees? And it starts to taste and smell the object and register it in the brain forever. After certain period of time, we stopped to give the inputs to our Brain for visualization. The Visualization starts when the baby opens his eyes and the visualization slowly alters depend upon the Inputs the baby is given to his brain. So when the baby stops giving the Input to the brain the visualization of the reality of the world stops there. Now we enter in to one more question, what the world we are visualizing is same as what the world animals are visualizing ? The answer for this question is also absolutely "No". There is a mythological tradition there in Hindu religion, that we need to feed crows before we eat that food. The roots of this Incident will give answers for our Question. The Crows are able to sense Poison availability in our food, due to this reason we are feeding crows before we eat. And one more another factor for difference in visualization we all know animals can't sense colours it will sense an object through IR rays. Through the above Incidents we come to know that Humans and Animals are visualizing this world from their own perspective. Now we will have one more Question, As a Human being Is we all visualizing this world in the same manner or we will also possess different visualization? We will discuss this Question now,  I will give you one more Incident which is more Interesting and it happened very recently 15 years back. We all know that there is an Island called North Sentinel Island which is Situated near Andaman and Nicobar. Until Now, No humans stepped into that Island, Now one question arises in our mind, why and what is in that Island which prohibits Human visits ? The Answer for this Query is that nothing unusual is happening, there are certain tribal peoples living in that Island in the coastal border of that Island. The development of these tribal people is about "How Humans lived 50,000 years ago ?" they are in the same kind of development right now. They didn't even discover fire on that Island. They will kill whoever enters that Island. They are not even having 1% of the knowledge we are having right now. A big natural disaster happened all throughout the world in December 2005, which is the Tsunami. Millions of People died all throughout the world. But there was no death on North sentinel island. you can ask me, How I am assuring there is no death happening on that Island ? The Indian Government sent coconuts to them as food through drones and helicopters after the tsunami, but interestingly they couldn't find no one living on the coastal side. They all shifted their residence to the top of the hill. Everyone was shocked by seeing how they sensed the Tsunami, before it came ? And after some time, they again started to reside on the coastal side of the Island. Do they have the capacity to sense natural disasters ? So the world that they are visualizing is different from what we are visualising. Now we will discuss one more fact that 4 to 5 % of the world population is different from normal human beings. Are you living in the world, where you can smell the Mango fruit from the sounds of piano notes ? Absolutely your answer will be No, right ? But it's not, we are living in that world only. There is a disorder called Synesthesia, where the person can smell from music or sounds. Not only this some person having this disorder will visualize some colors from sounds they hear. It doesn't mean that they won't hear the sound, they will hear the sound also. According to me, You need to understand there is a major difference between disease, disorder and syndrome. Disease is caused due to microorganisms, Syndrome is caused due to malfunctioning of organs and disorder is abnormal state. So Synesthesia persons are visualising this world in a different perspective like how dogs visualize through IR rays, but after many years only we discovered IR rays. We know that bats will travel from one place to another by sending ultrasonic sound waves which we weren't able to sense, that too we discovered very recently. So it is not that much quiet Interesting that in the near future in our scientific development we found that Sound waves will generate smells or it will generate a colour which we couldn't sense, because we are already having 4 to 5 % of the population living in this world with Synesthesia disorder.

  We Will Neglect Animals, we will just focus on Human beings we saw in our Article. There are 3 different visualizations of the reality of this world we come across in this article. That is:

  <br>

  <b>
    <ul>The Visualization of Reality, in the Perspective of Normal Human Being.</ul>
    <ul>The Visualization of Reality, in the Perspective of Tribal people, to sense Natural Disaster. </ul>
    <ul>The Visualization of Reality, in the Perspective of Synesthesia People.</ul>
  </b>

<br>
<p>
So in this we Understood that the world what we are currently viewing is not 100% reality, it is very less percentile. We will continue our Journey towards the findings of the connections between our Human brain and this Universe in our upcoming chapters in this article.
